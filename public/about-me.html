    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Get to know me a little bit more:</h2>
    <p>
      I am a senior physiotherapist transitioning into software
      development, passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative
      solutions, especially in health tech and app development. Outside of work
      and study, I enjoy spending quality time with my dog (when back in New
      Zealand), staying active at the gym, going for runs, and exploring
      Melbourne's amazing coffee and food scene. I find peace in nature,
      inspiration in creating music, and relaxation in a good book.
