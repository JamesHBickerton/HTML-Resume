    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a senior physiotherapist with five years of experience working in
      private practice and aged care across New Zealand and Australia. My career
      has been marked by leadership roles, mentorship, and a strong commitment
      to patient outcomes. I am now pursuing a transition into software
      development, starting with web development and front-end technologies. I
      aim to leverage my healthcare background and problem-solving skills to
      contribute to tech-driven innovations, particularly in health tech and app
      development.
